Because I got really enthusiastic about radare2 and I want more and more researchers to be familiar with it, use it and hopefully contribute to the project, I decided to create a series of articles and use-cases of r2. Since these articles aim to teach you the basics of radare2, its features and capabilities, I'll explain much more than you actually need to know in order to solve each task.
